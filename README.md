# The Rosewood Studios Online Stevecorder

This is the frontend of my personal project that I made in coding bootcamp. It is built using React, Web Audio API and the Microsoft Graph API. After connecting your Microsoft Account to access OneDrive (auth info only available to the user/stored in their browser), you can quickly record audio using any available input and upload it to your OneDrive to be able to be accessed from anywhere.
